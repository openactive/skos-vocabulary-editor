<h2>Developer Access</h2>
A <a href="https://openactive.io/<%= ENV['VOCAB_IDENTIFIER'] %>/<%= ENV['VOCAB_IDENTIFIER'] %>.jsonld">JSON-LD definition</a> of the OpenActive <%= ENV['VOCAB_NAME'] %> controlled vocabulary is available for live integration into applications.<br><br>
This controlled vocabulary SHOULD be retrieved frequently using an HTTP GET and cached within an application, to ensure that the most up-to-date version is displayed to the user, while also protecting against network failure when accessing the underlying resource. To access this controlled vocabulary the application MUST GET the URL <code class="highlighter-rouge">"https://openactive.io/<%= ENV['VOCAB_IDENTIFIER'] %>/<%= ENV['VOCAB_IDENTIFIER'] %>.jsonld"</code> (note there is no www in the URL) which does not require a specific <code class="highlighter-rouge">Accept</code> header, and is cached via CDN. The controlled vocabulary is also available via a GET of the URL <code class="highlighter-rouge">"https://openactive.io/<%= ENV['VOCAB_IDENTIFIER'] %>"</code> using an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Accept</code> header of <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/ld+json</code>, for completeness, however this shorter URL MUST NOT be used in production.<br><br>
